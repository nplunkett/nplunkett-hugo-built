<p>In October of 2018, I gave a brief Lightning Talk presentation at NANOG 74. It covered how I and my colleagues at CENIC identified and deployed a crafty low cost metro DWDM solution across CENIC&rsquo;s network backbone. The video recording of this talk is available in the Youtube URL above.</p>
<p>This was my first ever professional presentation. I was nervous and had a lot to cover during my 10 minute allocation but I had fun and learned a lot about what it takes to prepare and deliver a technical presentation to an audience of my professional peers. I also feel like I gained a lot of confidence toward presenting to larger groups and found that I actually might enjoy making presentations like this.</p>
<p>Fun fact about this talk - the solution was designed, deployed, and monitored in the field only days before giving the talk in person. The slide deck was being edited up to the last hour before I walked up on stage!</p>
<p>Speaking of the slide deck, if you&rsquo;d like to peruse it at your leisure, it is available here: <a href="https://pc.nanog.org/static/published/meetings/NANOG74/1851/20181002_Plunkett_Lightning_Talk_Lean_v2.pdf" target="_blank">Lean Disaggregated Regional Optical Transport at NANOG74 by Nick Plunkett</a>.</p>
