      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been looking for an easily deployable sFlow collector to receive and index sFlow data from various network hardware. I came across this post on sflow.com and am sharing it here because it was extremely helpful for me. I was able to get an sFlow collector up within 10 minutes using their Git repository and Docker, and once I got my network hardware configured, I was able to see traffic based on source and destination ASN with implied country based traffic as well. This is super powerful software that is all free and open source, I would highly recommend this if you&amp;rsquo;re just getting into sFlow data ingestion and querying.&#xA;https://blog.sflow.com/2023/07/deploy-real-time-network-dashboards.html&#xA;Internet archive link in case the previous link becomes unavailable: http://web.</description>
