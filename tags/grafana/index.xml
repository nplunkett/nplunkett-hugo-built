      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been looking for an easily deployable sFlow collector to receive and index sFlow data from various network hardware. I came across this post on sflow.com and am sharing it here because it was extremely helpful for me. I was able to get an sFlow collector up within 10 minutes using their Git repository and Docker, and once I got my network hardware configured, I was able to see traffic based on source and destination ASN with implied country based traffic as well. This is super powerful software that is all free and open source, I would highly recommend this if you&amp;rsquo;re just getting into sFlow data ingestion and querying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.sflow.com/2023/07/deploy-real-time-network-dashboards.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://blog.sflow.com/2023/07/deploy-real-time-network-dashboards.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Internet archive link in case the previous link becomes unavailable: &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20231004203143/https://blog.sflow.com/2023/07/deploy-real-time-network-dashboards.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20231004203143/https://blog.sflow.com/2023/07/deploy-real-time-network-dashboards.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
