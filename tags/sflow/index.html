        I&rsquo;ve recently been looking for an easily deployable sFlow collector to receive and index sFlow data from various network hardware. I came across this post on sflow.com and am sharing it here because it was extremely helpful for me. I was able to get an sFlow collector up within 10 minutes using their Git repository and Docker, and once I got my network hardware configured, I was able to see traffic based on source and destination ASN with implied country based traffic as well. This is super powerful software that is all free and open source, I would highly recommend this if you&rsquo;re just getting into sFlow data ingestion and querying.
